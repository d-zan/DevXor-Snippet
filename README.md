# DevXor Snippets
_____
**These snippets are designed to help you quickly create [DevXor-Handler](https://github.com/DevXor-Team/DevXorHandler) commands and events in your JavaScript projects.**

## Quick Start
1. Open your JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Download the `.vscode/DevXor.code-snippets` folder and place it in your project’s `.vscode` directory.
   - If the `.vscode` directory does not exist, create it in the root of your project.
   - Ensure that the `DevXor.code-snippets` file is placed directly inside the `.vscode` folder.
3. Use the following prefixes to trigger the snippets:
   - `cmd` or `dxc` for command snippets.
   - `evnts` or `event` for event snippets.
> [!NOTE]
> You can customize the prefixes in the `DevXor.code-snippets` file if needed.
